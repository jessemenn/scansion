#The Shout
#Simon Armitage

We went out  
into the school yard together, me and the boy  
whose name and face  
I don't remember. We were testing the range
of the human voice: 
he had to shout for all he was worth, 
I had to raise an arm 
from across the divide to signal back 
that the sound had carried. 
He called from over the park - I lifted an arm. 
Out of bounds, 
he yelled from the end of the road, 
from the foot of the hill,
from beyond the look-out post of FretwelFs Farm -  
I lifted an arm. 
He left town, went on to be twenty years dead
with a gunshot hole
in the roof of his mouth, in Western Australia. 
Boy with the name and face I don't remember, 
you can stop shouting now, I can still hear you.
