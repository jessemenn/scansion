#Double Exposures - III. Group Photo with Winter Trees

These were my neighbors. It's a big group pose: 
On mist-gray skies, the stark, black branches etch 
Horizon, lawn, in loose haphazard rows. 
As if in tin, or as in some old sketch, 
That's The Great Bob. And that's our good Queen Paul 
Whose lines, whose every nuance was precise, 
With Champagne Anne and Rick the dog. They're all 
But faded now. I've seen the trees in ice, 
Decked out (Liz, too, who helped me do the plumbing),
But I'll be gone when their spring blooms and scatters
Even the children. And, God, they're all becoming. 
Shades, as the new leaves turn to other matters.
