We passengers ride backward on the train
And train our eyes on what has passed us by.
A cobalt blur composes
Into a woman picking roses,
Who is already fading in the pane
As in the failing hindsight of the eye. 
A line of oaks comes into focus, fades, 
Supplanted by the double-dagger poles 
Of power companies, 
Footnotes that redefine the trees.
An asterisk in glass, then window shades,
Graffiti, billboards, tattered banderoles
Of southbound birds. . . . Whatever comes to view
Corrects the view, but never will explain
The random next event 
Or anything but where we went, 
Where long ago a woman wearing blue 
Began forgetting someone on a train.
