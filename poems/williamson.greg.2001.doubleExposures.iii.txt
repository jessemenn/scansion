#Double Exposures - III. Visiting Couple Kissing and Halved Onion

Unjustly I've imposed upon my friends 
This? It's an onion that's been cut in half 
When they're (how shall I say?) making amends 
Right in the middle of the photograph, 
After a night of words, and here they stand 
Less like those pure, textbook transparencies 
Wrapped up in one another, hand in hand, 
Than layered and opaque identities, 
An arm around a shoulder, face to face,
Developed in the dark to this full kit
And captured in this rapturous embrace. 
Which has so many tears inside of it.
